(** A pathological bot: submits an order, immediately cancels it, and
    repeats forever.

    This bot is deliberately adversarial. It targets three things at once:

    - The cancel path itself ([cancel_order_rpc] / {!Matching_engine.cancel}).
    - The submit/accept/cancel event flow on the bot's own session-feed pipe
      — every pair produces (at least) an [Order_accept] and an
      [Order_cancel], back to back.
    - The duplicate-client-order-id bookkeeping from Part 2. Each order uses
      a fresh [Client_order_id.t] that is never reused, because
      {!Matching_engine}'s [orders_by_client_id] table
      (lib/order_book/src/matching_engine.ml) never frees an entry — not on
      cancel, not on fill. A storm that runs forever grows that table
      forever, one entry per order, even though every order it produced is
      long gone from the book. That unbounded growth (not the cancel RPC
      itself) is the real thing to watch on a dashboard.

    Cancels are fired immediately after submitting, without waiting for the
    [Order_accept] to come back: {!Bot_runtime.Context.cancel} takes the
    client-chosen [Client_order_id.t], which this bot already knows the
    moment it builds the request, so there is nothing to wait for. This
    mirrors what a real misbehaving client can do.

    Driven by the [Cancel_storm] scenario in {!Jsip_scenarios.Cancel_storm}.
    Satisfies {!Jsip_bot_runtime.Bot_runtime.Bot}, so it plugs into
    {!Jsip_scenario_runner.Bot_spec.t} the same way
    {!Jsip_market_maker.Market_maker} does. *)
